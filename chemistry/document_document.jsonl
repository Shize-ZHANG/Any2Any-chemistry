    "content": "Wild-type Herpesvirus saimiri expressing HSUR1/2 selectively lowers cellular miR-27a/b by accelerating decay after processing, since precursor levels and passenger strands are unchanged. A radiolabeled pulse–chase shows miR-27a degrades faster in wild-type than in HSUR-deficient cells, while miR-16 is unaffected, indicating selectivity. Functionally, reduced miR-27 correlates with increased FOXO1 protein; HSUR1 knockdown reverses this pattern, identifying HSUR1 as the principal mediator of this post-transcriptional control. A clean, formatted version of this summary is provided in <document2>."
